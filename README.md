## Utility Meter Data Analytics Quick Start

This Quick Start deploys the Meter Data Analytics (MDA) Platform on the AWS Cloud. The MDA helps utilities tap the unrealized value of energy consumption data like load prediction on the household, circuit, and distribution system level, deeper customer engagement through proactive notifications, predictive maintenance on distribution assets, circuit quality analytics, and much more while removing undifferentiated heavy lifting for utilities. AWS MDA uses a data lake and machine learning capabilities to store the incoming meter reads, analyze them, and provide valuable insights.
