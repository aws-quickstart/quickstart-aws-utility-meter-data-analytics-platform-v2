This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start deploys a platform that uses machine learning (ML) to help you analyze data from smart utility meters. It's for utility companies or other organizations that are looking to gain insights from smart-meter data. This data comes from meter data management (MDM) or similar systems. Insights include unusual energy usage, energy-usage forecasts, and meter-outage details.

Except for Amazon Redshift, this is a serverless architecture.
