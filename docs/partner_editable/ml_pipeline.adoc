== How to retrain the model or use a custom model in the pipeline
This Quick Start deploys an ML pipeline, including a model-training workflow and a batch-processing workflow. This pipeline generates data that becomes the basis for forecasts and anomaly results. The initial deployment runs both workflows after ETL jobs are done.
