== FAQ

*Q. I encountered a CREATE_FAILED error when I launched the Quick Start.*

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Be sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q. I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.*

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q. Does the Quick Start replace the existing MDMS from ISVs that utility companies have today?*

*A.* Utility customers have expressed a need to break down data silos and bring greater value out of their data, specifically case meter data. They have asked for AWS best practices for storing meter data in a data lake, and for help getting started running analytics and ML against that data to derive value for their own customers. This Quick Start directly answers these needs. Utility commpanies can hydrate the AWS data lake with data from their existing systems and continue to evolve the Quick Start architecture to meet their business needs. Customers, solution providers, and system integrators can take advantage of this Quick Start to start applying ML against meter data in a matter of days.

*Q. Does the Quick Start include a connectivity (topology) model?*

*A.* No. However, S3 is an object store and can hold any type of data, so you can modify it to hold a copy of the topology model from a utilities Geographic Information System (GIS).

*Q. What meter dataset is included with the Quick Start?*

*A.* The Quick Start does not include meter data, but instead includes instructions on how to download a public dataset from the city of London, UK, including 5,567 households from November 2011 to February 2014.

*Q. What weather data is included with the Quick Start?*

*A.* The Quick Start does not include weather data, but instead includes instructions on how to download a public dataset. This weather data aligns with the geographical area and time period provided for London.

*Q. Are any public datasets with large volumes of sample or anonymized smart meter data available?*

*A.* Not at this time, although Amazon, via the Registry of OpenData on AWS (RODA) project, is currently researching options. Utility of Meter manufacturers can donate datasets for https://registry.opendata.aws/[public use^].

*Q. Will the register and interval reads be taken into the data lake?*

*A.* Yes. The data lake can take and process multiple reading types. Register and interval reads are stored in the data lake. However, only the interval data is used for the model training.

*Q. Does the Quick Start include publicly available data about homes (for example, sqft) based on address?*

*A.* No. Currently the Quick Start doesn't include this information.

*Q. How is the meter data structured in the data lake, and why is the data model standardized this way?*

*A.* See information about the internal data structure in the *Table schemas* section in this deployment guide. The internal data schema is the result of working backwards from the requirements and talking to Partners with a long history of industry experience. Future use cases are possible for implementation. For information about separating the data lake into three layers, see https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-releases-smart-meter-data-analytics-platform/[AWS releases smart meter data analytics^].

*Q. Are there any other similar solutions that you are aware of, either from other cloud providers or on-premises solutions?*

*A.* Some AWS Partners are working to adopt the Quick Start as a starting point and then build on top of it. When it comes to on-premises solutions, most utility companies have meter data and an MDM, and do some degree of analytics against the data. Very few do any form of ML against the data. Most want to do more, and do it in the cloud, to free themselves from the costs and constraints of on-premises analytics and ML.

*Q. Are the ML models pre-trained?*

*A.* No. The Quick Start contains data pipelines and notebooks for loading and training the models using your own data.

*Q. What type of ML model is used for energy forcasting? Do I have to train a separate model for each meter?*

*A.* The Quick Start uses the Amazon SageMaker DeepAR forecasting algorithm, which is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting scalar (one-dimensional) time series using recurrent neural networks (RNN). This approach automatically produces a global model from historical data of all time series data (for example, data from all your meters) in the dataset. This allows you to have one model consumption forecasting, rather than a model for each meter. Note that this doesn’t mean one model can be used forever; you should retrain the model periodically to learn new patterns.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html[DeepAR Forecasting Algorithm^] and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301888[DeepAR: Probabilistic forecasting with autoregressive recurrent networks^].

*Q. For energy forecasting, does the ML model take weather into account? If so, how do I include weather data with meter data for training?*

*A.* Weather data is optional. See the *(Optional) Prepare weather data for use in training and forecasting* section in this guide for instructions on how to use weather information as part of the training pipeline, including the weather data format. The data structure that is expected for weather information is also explained. 

*Q. For energy forecasting, can you provide an example of how I would query the Forecast API for next week's forecast energy usage with and without a weather forecast?*

*A.* See the *Data schema and API I/O format* section in this guide for API descriptions with example requests that demonstrate usage. Also, the provided Jupyter Notebook provides example implementation usage of the API. 

*Q. What model is used for anomaly detection?*

*A.* The Quick Start uses the https://facebook.github.io/prophet/[Prophet library^] for anomaly detection. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time-series data based on an additive model where nonlinear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality plus holiday effects. It doesn’t support a feedback loop. You can choose to use other algorithms.

*Q. Which use cases are available in the Quick Start for anomaly detection?*

*A.* From a anomaly-detection perspective, the Quick Start supports the detection of abnormal usage (higher or lower than expected range) in a certain time period based on historic data.

*Q. Has any financial information been included for any of the forecasts, for example, to forecast the most cost-effective generation source to cover peak loads and prevent brownouts or blackouts?*

*A.* No. Currently the only forecast use case that supported is meter usage.

*Q. Since meter data is time-series data, why is the Quick Start not using Amazon Timestream as a data store?*

*A.* Timestream was not available at the time this Quick Start was published, although it will be considered for future iterations. Timestream is a good option for certain use cases such as real-time dashboards.
